RNA-Seq project on wheat genome

My name is Brendan Jamison. I recently graduated from the University of Illinois @ Urbana-Champaign with a bachelors in Biology, and I am currently working on a transcriptome assembly and differential gene expression analysis with RNA-Seq data from wheat leaf tissue treated with an herbicide safener. I'm new to coding so I decided to make GitHub account in hopes that I could get some help every once in a while. Thanks in advance!
